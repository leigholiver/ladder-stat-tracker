# ladder-stat-tracker
A (mostly) automated ladder stat tracker for sc2 streamers

usage: 
download ladder-stat-tracker.exe
add scores.txt to your streaming software as a text source

issues due to api limitations:
- if you have the same name as your opponent, you have to click a button to confirm the result
- if you play vs random, you have to click a button to confirm the race
